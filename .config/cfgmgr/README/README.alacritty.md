Alacritty Configuration
================================================================================

My current terminal of choice is
[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), partly because of its
minimalism, but mostly because it supports Unicode input and plays nicely with
[Fcitx](https://fcitx-im.org/wiki/Fcitx) when typing in Chinese or Russian.

I recommend my script
[ConfigManager](https://github.com/hendrik-s-debruin/ConfigManager) for cloning
this repository.
